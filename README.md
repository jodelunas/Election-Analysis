## Challenge Overview
To complet an election audit based on the CSV file received. Learn how to pull the information needed from the file.
## Challenge Summary
The first step was to improt the file to VS code and create variables to load, read, and save the files. The next step was to create a list and dictionary to hold the information needed. I then need to create a for loop to pull information from the file and put it in the prespective dictionary and list. I had to create conditional formats to filter information. Codes were written to get the information needed in the Project overview from the dictionary and lists. I then needed to write the results to a text file.
